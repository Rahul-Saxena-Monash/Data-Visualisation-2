        <h1>Ocean Acidification</h1>
        <div class="container">

                <h2>pH Deviation Map</h2>
                <p>This map shows the deviation of pH in the ocean surrounding Australia from the global average in 2013. The global average is calculated by taking the mean pH value across all measured locations for that year.</p>
                <p>The pH deviation is measured using the pH scale, where a deviation of 0 represents the global average.</p>
                <p><strong>Color Scale Explanation:</strong> The visualization uses a color scale inspired by the ColorBrewer diverging scale, designed for clear differentiation between values above and below a midpoint. The scale transitions from a distinct red for the most acidic conditions, through orange, light yellow, light blue, to a deeper blue for the most basic conditions. This color scheme provides a clear visual representation of pH deviations, making it easier to interpret the data at a glance.</p>
                <p>This visualization helps identify areas where ocean acidification is more pronounced or where local factors might be influencing pH levels.</p>
                <div id="ph-deviation-chart"></div>
                <h3>pH Deviation Over Time</h3>
                <p>The following chart illustrates how the average pH deviation has changed over the decades, from the 1870s to the 2010s.</p>
                <p>Each bar represents a decade, with the length and color of the bar indicating the average pH deviation for that period. This allows us to see long-term trends in ocean acidification:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bars extending to the right (blue) show decades with higher average pH (more basic conditions).</li>
                    <li>Bars extending to the left (red) indicate decades with lower average pH (more acidic conditions).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The color scale is consistent with the map above, using the same ColorBrewer-inspired diverging scale to represent pH deviations.</p>

                <h2>Ocean Acidification Time Series</h2>
                <p>This interactive chart shows changes in key variables related to ocean acidification over time. Use the dropdown menu to select different variables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>pH:</strong> Measures acidity. A decreasing trend indicates increasing acidity, which can harm marine organisms, especially those with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sea Surface Temperature (SST):</strong> Rising temperatures can accelerate chemical reactions and reduce the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2, exacerbating acidification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sea Surface Salinity (SSS):</strong> Changes in salinity can affect the ocean's ability to absorb CO2 and impact marine ecosystems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aragonite Saturation State (OMEGA_A):</strong> A decreasing value indicates it's harder for marine organisms to form aragonite shells, crucial for many species' survival.</li>
                    <li><strong>Calcite Saturation State (OMEGA_C):</strong> Similar to aragonite, a lower value makes it more difficult for organisms to form calcite shells, affecting various marine species.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Deviation:</strong> Shows how much the pH differs from the long-term average, helping to identify periods of significant change.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note on Color Scheme:</strong> Unlike other charts in this dashboard, this time series chart does not use a color scheme to represent values. The interactive nature of the chart, allowing users to switch between variables with vastly different scales, makes it challenging to implement a meaningful and consistent color scale. A simple color scale (like the litmus scale used in other charts) could be misleading when applied across all variables due to their different ranges and units of measurement. Instead, I encourage you to focus on the trends and patterns in the data for each variable individually.</p>

                <h2>Ocean Acidification Heatmaps</h2>
                <p>These heatmaps provide a comprehensive view of changes in all variables related to ocean acidification over time. The color intensity represents the deviation from the mean value for each variable, using the same color scale as the pH deviation charts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red colors indicate lower values (more acidic for pH-related variables)</li>
                    <li>Blue colors indicate higher values (more basic for pH-related variables)</li>
                    <li>Yellow represents values close to the mean</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Global Normalization Heatmap</h3>
                <p>This heatmap uses global normalization, allowing direct comparison between variables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each row represents a different variable.</li>
                    <li>Each column represents a specific point in time.</li>
                    <li>The color intensity shows how much each value deviates from the overall mean across all variables and time points.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This visualization helps identify periods when multiple variables showed significant changes simultaneously, potentially indicating major shifts in ocean chemistry.</p>
                <p>Note the significant fluctuations in Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) values over time. These variations can be attributed to several factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seasonal changes: SSS can vary greatly between seasons due to differences in precipitation, evaporation, and freshwater input from rivers.</li>
                    <li>Temperature effects: As seawater temperature changes, it can affect evaporation rates, which in turn influences salinity.</li>
                    <li>Ocean currents: Changes in ocean circulation patterns can bring water masses with different salinities into the area.</li>
                    <li>Climate events: Phenomena like El Niño or La Niña can cause significant short-term changes in SSS.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These fluctuations in SSS can have important implications for ocean chemistry and marine life, as salinity affects water density, ocean circulation, and the ability of the ocean to absorb CO2.</p>
                <div id="global-heatmap"></div>
                <h3>Independent Normalization Heatmap</h3>
                <p>This heatmap uses independent normalization for each variable:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each variable is normalized separately based on its own mean and standard deviation.</li>
                    <li>This approach highlights relative changes within each variable over time.</li>
                    <li>It's particularly useful for identifying trends and patterns specific to each variable, regardless of their absolute scale.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This visualization allows us to see how each variable has changed relative to its own historical values, making it easier to spot trends that might be less apparent in the global normalization view.</p>
